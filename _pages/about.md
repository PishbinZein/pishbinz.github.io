I’m Zein, a second-year Master’s student at PSL University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Data.

Before joining PSL, I was a research intern at the University of Warsaw, where I had the privilege of working under the supervision of [Piotr Skowron](https://duch.mimuw.edu.pl/~ps219737/).

My current research focuses on ***computational social choice***, particularly proportionality in voting settings. More broadly, I am interested in the algorithmic aspects of collective decision-making, fairness, and strategic behavior.

For more details, please check my [CV](/cv/) or contact me by email.
